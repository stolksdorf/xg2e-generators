# xg2e-generators
A series of random generators from the D&amp;D supplemental book: [Xanathar's Guide To Everything](http://dnd.wizards.com/products/tabletop-games/rpg-products/xanathars-guide-everything)

This library exposes the random generators from Xanathar's Guide To Everything. It can produce NPCs, entire fmaily's, notable lif events, punishments for crimes, even entire characters.

- The OCR on the book I have was quite poor, especially with the names. There are many errors that will need to be fixed
- I have not found a good source to generate random ages per race yet.
